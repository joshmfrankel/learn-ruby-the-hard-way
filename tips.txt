Read your .rb file backward.
Read your .rb file out loud, saying even the characters.
Make it personal (Try making the numbers in this script your measurements. It's weird, but talking about yourself will make it seem more real. Also, you're just starting out so it won't make too much sense. Keep going and more exercises will explain it more.)
